D2GS 1.12a (build 01) by marsgod

First, this is a TRUE Diablo 1.12a D2GS!
So, you need a 1.12a Diablo to make it work. I strongly recommend that you use the Patch_D2.mpq (version 1.12a) from battle.net.

You can follow the instruction in D2GS_README.TXT to install the d2gs.
The d2gs.script should be copied to your Diablo installed directory with d2server.dll.


This D2GS can work with the latest PVPGN.
